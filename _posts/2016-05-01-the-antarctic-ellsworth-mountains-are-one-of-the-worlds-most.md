description: 'The Antarctic Ellsworth Mountains are one of the worlds most remarkable and remote ‘adventure playgrounds’, attracting some of the most adventurous climbers, explorers and travellers on the planet. Over the last 25 years, Antarctic Logistics and Expeditions (ALE) and Adventure Network International (ANI) have made it possible to access this unique location, providing the spring board for some of the most remarkable adventures in Antarctic history. In addition to providing unparalleled support for adventure tourism in the region, these two companies have also always been enthusiastic supporters of Antarctic science. With this in mind, ALE were enthusiastic partners in a five-year funded Australian Research Council (ARC) Linkage Project formulated and led by Chris Fogwill and Chris Turney from The University of New South Wales (UNSW) to explore the long term climate and glacial history of the Ellsworth Mountains. This website is designed to give a taste of the work being undertaken and the extraordinary insights this region is providing into understanding past, present and future global environmental change.
